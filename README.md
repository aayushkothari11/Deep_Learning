# Deep Learning
This repository contains all the codes which I followed while watching a tutorial.

Notable projects:

1. Digit Recognition using MNIST dataset - https://github.com/aayushkothari11/Deep_Learning/blob/master/Neural-Nets/MNIST.ipynb


2. Neural Style Transfer - https://github.com/aayushkothari11/Deep_Learning/blob/master/Neural-Nets/neural_style_transfer.ipynb


3. Lyrics Generation using character level - https://github.com/aayushkothari11/Deep_Learning/blob/master/Neural-Nets/lyrics_generator.ipynb
